The machine learning scenario we are considering is *sentiment polarity* classification of product reviews: the task is to classify a given review as positive or negative towards the product that is reviewed. In this case, we have a *domain* shift: we see what happens if we evaluate a classifier trained on book reviews on a test set consisting of camera reviews, and vice versa.\n",

    "Finally, we print the results. As you can see, in both cases where we have a domain shift there is a significant drop in  accuracy. The domain shift causes the accuracy of the book review classifier to drop by about 5 percent points, and more than 20 percent points for the camera review classifier! The magnitude of this drop is related to the degree of similarity between the domains (book reviews and camera reviews): if the two categories had been more similar, e.g. analog and digital cameras, the drop would probably have been smaller. (If you take a look at the paper by Blitzer et al., you can see that they introduce a formal measure that is intended to quantify the distance between domains.)\n",

    "I was asked by a student in class why we see this asymmetry: why is the drop so much greater for the camera review classifier? I don't think it has anything to do with the division into training and test sets: if you change the `random_state` above, you will see very similar results. Speculating, it may be that there is a greater diversity of evaluative expressions in the book review dataset, some of which carry over to the camera reviews, while the camera reviews might be less diverse. But as I mentioned, this is speculation."
