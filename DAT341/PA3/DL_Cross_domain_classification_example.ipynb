    "# Example of cross-domain classification with Deep Learning based methods\n",
    "This is largely a copy of the `Cross-domain classification example.ipynb` notebook. The main difference is that this notebook makes use of deep learning based methods for solving the classification task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebooks shows an example of how the performance of machine learning algorithms is affected by shifts in the data distributions between training and evaluation. The machine learning scenario we are considering is *sentiment polarity* classification of product reviews: the task is to classify a given review as positive or negative towards the product that is reviewed. In this case, we have a *domain* shift: we see what happens if we evaluate a classifier trained on book reviews on a test set consisting of camera reviews, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note** Training neural networks is computationally demanding and may take time if you run it on your laptop. Running the code in Google Colab will likely be faster and you can even get access to a GPU. We here assume that you are running this notebook in Google Colab, while running it on other computers with GPUs also works.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note** To enable GPU hardware acceleration in Google Colab, click the `Change runtime type` field in the `runtime` drop-down menu, then choose `GPU` under hardware acceleration. One T4 GPU is sufficient for the computations in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note** If you are using Google Colab and you would like to export the notebook to HTML format, you need to first download it through `File` $\\rightarrow$ `Download as` $\\rightarrow$ `ipynb` and then use the standard tool for Jupyter Notebook conversion, nbconvert: jupyter nbconvert --to html notebook.ipynb (you need to run it from the command line). For more info (and example), see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53460051/convert-ipynb-notebook-to-html-in-google-colab)."

    "We are now ready to define and train our deep learning based model. We will make use of the pretrained [DistilBERT base uncased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased) model with 66M trainable parameters. It was developed by [Sanh et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01108.pdf) and is a lighter version of the common [BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf) (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model (with 110M parameters). Like BERT, DistilBERT computes contextualized representations of text that are useful for solving different tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though DistilBERT has been optimized for lightness, it is a large neural network that requires pretraining and needs to be run on a GPU. It makes use of Transformers and Attention to process text. This model is more advanced compared to e.g. RNNs or word counting and represents a light version of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"true\" SOTA model for text classification is something like [RoBERTa-large cased](https://huggingface.co/FacebookAI/roberta-large) with 355M parameters. Due to its sheer size, we will not consider the RoBERTa model in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenizer\n",
    "The tokenizer makes out an important part of each DL based models. Text is non-euclidian, and to convert this to something computers can process (=numbers), tokenization and word embeddings are typically used. Usually, each NLP model comes with its own tokenizer that was used to pretrain it. Tokenizers can be implemented in several different ways, but they all have in common that they transform text into subparts (tokens) assigned unique numbers. They can then be mapped to pre-trained word embeddings that aim to represent the \"meaning\" of each word as a multi-dimensional vector.\n",

    "More information on how tokenizers are implemented can be found on the [Huggingface website](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer).\n",

Instead, the data is processed in _batches_ of 32 samples at a time."

    "One important limitation of models based on Transformers is that they can only process inputs up to a maximum length due to performance issues. Dissimilarly to RNNs, these models do not process the input recursively, but all at once and up to a maximum input length. A maximum input length has to be defined as the computational cost of the Transformer scales quadtratically with the input length. This is a current issue for most NLP models and has up to this point no definitive solution.\n",
